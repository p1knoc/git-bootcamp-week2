# Day 3 Learning Notes

## Forking & Pull Requests

### Major Breakthroughs

#### Fork Workflow Understanding
I finally get it! Forking creates MY copy where I can do anything, then I propose changes back via PRs. This is how open source works!

#### Pull Request Power
PRs aren't just for code submission - they're:
- Communication tools
- Documentation of decisions
- History of project evolution
- Learning opportunities

### Key Concepts Mastered

#### Fork vs Clone
- Clone: For repos I have access to
- Fork: For contributing to external projects
- Fork creates GitHub copy, then I clone that

#### Upstream vs Origin
```
upstream -> original repo (read only for me)
origin -> my fork (full control)
local -> my computer
```

#### PR Lifescycle
1. Fork/Clone
2. Branch
3. Code
4. Push
5. Create PR
6. Review/Discussion
7. Revisions
8. Approval
9. Merge
10. Celebration!
